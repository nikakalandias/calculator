# calculator

Hi! This is my first project which one I uploaded in GitHub. 
On the journey to become an iOS Developer I needed to learn use GitHub!

I selected calculator for my first project because of Calculator is so simple and I can improve easily.

Anyways! This is my first small step on GitHub but not to be a last!


(I know my English sucks but I'm improving it and when I looking back I will proudly read this..)
