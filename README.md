# calculator

30.09.2021

Hi! This is my first project which one I uploaded in GitHub. 
On the journey to become an iOS Developer I needed to learn use GitHub!

I selected calculator for my first project because of Calculator is so simple and I can improve easily.

Anyways! This is my first small step on GitHub but not to be a last!


(I know my English sucks but I'm improving it and when I looking back I will proudly read this..)

Huh! I'm so proud with myself. In these 4-5 days I learned use GitHub a little bit.
Today I added if-else command in my app. In previous version when you entry string, my app is crashed.
I solved this problem with if-else commands. If enter another character in textfield, app is prints error message.

I can more improve this app!
